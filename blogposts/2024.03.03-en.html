	<h2>Inaugurating my home on the Internet after 10 years of fear.<h2>
	<h4>03.03.2024<h4>
	<!--<p>Since I was young, I always wanted to have a site. But I was afraid that people would visit it. </p>
	<p>Really, what I wanted was a record of me. A memory of the past and the future, so that I could understand my being just that bit easier. And besides, it's a weekend's worth of effort.</p>
	<p>The only stipulation of such a record (which some upsettingly call a 'diary') is that it should be personal. To read another's diary is to lay witness to a more intense form of disk defragmentation. 
		The reorganization of months of disparate memory recalls and errors, for the sake of the efficiency of the system. You know what, I can go with this metaphor.
		I read an entry from my diary, the physical one, to a girl last year. One that I very much liked, not the entry, but the girl. And I confirmed that making
		public the process of disk defragmentation should not happen.</p>
	<p>Then, why write? Simply put, masochism is the most unstoppable historical force. So welcome aboard, and I hope that you may take some joy from my suffering!</p>
